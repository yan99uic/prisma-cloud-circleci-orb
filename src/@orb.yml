  This orb is a wrapper for Prisma cloud IaC Scan and Prisma Cloud Compute Scanning tools from Palo Alto Networks. 
  Prisma Cloud IaC Scan identifies insecure configurations in common Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates - for example, 
  AWS Cloud Formation Templates, HashiCorp Terraform templates, Kubernetes App Deployment YAML files. 
  Prisma Cloud Compute TwistCLI Scan can be used to identify vulnerabilities in container images. 
  More details about the functionality can be found here:

# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
